For<br>            example, for an 802.x interface, this object normally<br>            contains a MAC address.  The interface's media-specific MIB<br>            must define the bit and byte ordering and the format of the<br>            value of this object.  For interfaces which do not have such<br>            an address (e.g., a serial line), this object should contain<br>            an octet string of zero length.</div>

            <div class="htmlContent">This table contains one entry per interface.  It defines<br>            objects which allow a network manager to instruct an agent<br>            to test an interface for various faults.  Tests for an<br>            interface are defined in the media-specific MIB for that<br>            interface.  After invoking a test, the object ifTestResult<br>            can be read to determine the outcome.  If an agent can not<br>            perform the test, ifTestResult is set to so indicate.  The<br>            object ifTestCode can be used to provide further test-<br>            specific or interface-specific (or even enterprise-specific)<br>            information concerning the outcome of the test.  Only one<br>            test can be in progress on each interface at any one time.<br>            If one test is in progress when another test is invoked, the<br>            second test is rejected.  Some agents may reject a test when<br>            a prior test is active on another interface.<br><br>            Before starting a test, a manager-station must first obtain<br>            'ownership' of the entry in the ifTestTable for the<br>            interface to be tested.  This is accomplished with the<br>            ifTestId and ifTestStatus objects as follows:<br><br>          try_again:<br>              get (ifTestId, ifTestStatus)<br>              while (ifTestStatus != notInUse)<br>                  /*<br>                   * Loop while a test is running or some other<br>                   * manager is configuring a test.<br>                   */<br>                  short delay<br>                  get (ifTestId, ifTestStatus)<br>              }<br><br>              /*<br>               * Is not being used right now -- let's compete<br>               * to see who gets it.<br>               */<br>              lock_value = ifTestId<br><br>              if ( set(ifTestId = lock_value, ifTestStatus = inUse,<br>                       ifTestOwner = 'my-IP-address') == FAILURE)<br>                  /*<br>                   * Another manager got the ifTestEntry -- go<br>                   * try again<br>                   */<br>                  goto try_again;<br><br>              /*<br>               * I have the lock<br>               */<br>              set up any test parameters.<br><br>              /*<br>               * This starts the test<br>               */<br>              set(ifTestType = test_to_run);<br><br>              wait for test completion by polling ifTestResult<br><br>              when test completes, agent sets ifTestResult<br>                   agent also sets ifTestStatus = 'notInUse'<br><br>              retrieve any additional test results, and ifTestId<br><br>              if (ifTestId == lock_value+1) results are valid<br><br>            A manager station first retrieves the value of the<br>            appropriate ifTestId and ifTestStatus objects, periodically<br>            repeating the retrieval if necessary, until the value of<br>            ifTestStatus is 'notInUse'.  The manager station then tries<br>            to set the same ifTestId object to the value it just<br>            retrieved, the same ifTestStatus object to 'inUse', and the<br>            corresponding ifTestOwner object to a value indicating<br>            itself.  If the set operation succeeds then the manager has<br>            obtained ownership of the ifTestEntry, and the value of the<br>            ifTestId object is incremented by the agent (per the<br>            semantics of TestAndIncr).  Failure of the set operation<br>            indicates that some other manager has obtained ownership of<br>            the ifTestEntry.<br><br>            Once ownership is obtained, any test parameters can be<br>            setup, and then the test is initiated by setting ifTestType.<br>            On completion of the test, the agent sets ifTestStatus to<br>            'notInUse'.  Once this occurs, the manager can retrieve the<br>            results.  In the (rare) event that the invocation of tests<br>            by two network managers were to overlap, then there would be<br>            a possibility that the first test's results might be<br>            overwritten by the second test's results prior to the first<br>            results being read.  This unlikely circumstance can be<br>            detected by a network manager retrieving ifTestId at the<br>            same time as retrieving the test results, and ensuring that<br>            the results are for the desired request.<br><br>            If ifTestType is not set within an abnormally long period of<br>            time after ownership is obtained, the agent should time-out<br>            the manager, and reset the value of the ifTestStatus object<br>            back to 'notInUse'.  It is suggested that this time-out<br>            period be 5 minutes.<br><br>            In general, a management station must not retransmit a<br>            request to invoke a test for which it does not receive a<br>            response; instead, it properly inspects an agent's MIB to<br>            determine if the invocation was successful.  Only if the<br>            invocation was unsuccessful, is the invocation request<br>            retransmitted.<br><br>            Some tests may require the interface to be taken off-line in<br>            order to execute them, or may even require the agent to<br>            reboot after completion of the test.  In these<br>            circumstances, communication with the management station<br>            invoking the test may be lost until after completion of the<br>            test.  An agent is not required to support such tests.<br>            However, if such tests are supported, then the agent should<br>            make every effort to transmit a response to the request<br>            which invoked the test prior to losing communication.  When<br>            the agent is restored to normal service, the results of the<br>            test are properly made available in the appropriate objects.<br>            Note that this requires that the ifIndex value assigned to<br>            an interface must be unchanged even if the test causes a<br>            reboot.  An agent must reject any test for which it cannot,<br>            perhaps due to resource constraints, make available at least<br>            the minimum amount of information after that test<br>            completes.</div>

However, this document assigns<br>            a value for a full-duplex loopback test, and defines the<br>            special meanings of the subject identifier:<br><br>                noTest  OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 0 0 }<br><br>            When the value noTest is written to this object, no action<br>            is taken unless a test is in progress, in which case the<br>            test is aborted.  Writing any other value to this object is<br>            only valid when no test is currently in progress, in which<br>            case the indicated test is initiated.<br><br>            When read, this object always returns the most recent value<br>            that ifTestType was set to.  If it has not been set since<br>            the last initialization of the network management subsystem<br>            on the agent, a value of noTest is returned.</div>
