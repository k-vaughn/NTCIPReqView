To affect a priority request, its scope includes the content of messages to be exchanged between a prioritizing entity and a controller, the sequence in which messages are exchanged, and associated functions within a controller related to SCP.

The controller unit has 'maintained coordination' following completion of a priority service request if upon resumption of normal operation the split timings occur at the appropriate points in the cycle. The intent is that the controller cycles back to or remains in the coordinated phase(s) such that they are green at the zero point in the cycle following completion of the priority service request and then time the allotted split time from that point. Skipping the coordinated phase(s) in any one cycle shall not be permitted.</li><li>A service request is complete when [priorityRequestTimeOfServiceDesired (TSD) and priorityRequestTimeOfEstimatedDeparture (TED) have passed OR priority phase(s) have timed the maximum split extension OR priority has been cancelled] AND non-priority split reduction(s) equal priority split extension(s). Once the service request is complete, priority omits (phase and pedestrian) shall be removed.</li><li>Once the CO has completed the service request, the CO shall set priorityStrategyRequestStatusInCO to ‘closedCompleted’ and reset priorityRequestReserviceTimer to ‘0’.</li><li>If priorityStrategyRequestStatusInCO is ‘activeOverride’, the CO may be able to complete the current request without affecting the need to cancel the CO. If it can, the CO would return priorityStrategyRequestStatusInCO set to ‘activeNotOverridden’. If not, it completes the active strategy as though the TSD and TED have passed and then sets priorityStrategyRequestStatusInCO to ‘readyOverridden’.</li><li>If priorityStrategyRequestStatusInCO is ‘activeCancel’, the CO shall complete the active strategy as though the TSD and TED have passed.
