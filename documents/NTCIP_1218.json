If an agency wishes to use either a central management system or additional RSUs from a different manufacturer, the agency encounters significant systems integration challenges, requiring additional resources to address. These additional resource requirements inhibit information sharing within and between various potential users of the data and prevent manufacturer interoperability from a common remote monitoring and management platform/system.

An agency specification needs to identify the requirements of a particular project and needs to require the support of those requirements. A specification writer is advised to match the requirements of a project with the corresponding standardized requirements defined in NTCIP 1218 v01A to achieve interoperability.

The requirement suggests that the message is stored (e.g., as a standard SNMP operation rather than coming into a separate port) and immediately forwarded (i.e., still a single operation). The purpose of the storage is unclear.</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: rgb(247, 218, 100);\">The design also fails to satisfy the requirement or the user need. The design stores the message (one operation) and then allows a second operation to enable the forwarding of the message.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: rgb(247, 218, 100);\">separate action to send the message (i.e., by the ITS application entity; a higher-layer function).

Is this true network layer forwarding (i.e., the entire APDU is forwarded and the storage is strictly for auditing purposes) or is there additional functionality being implied (e.g., \"store and repeatedly broadcast\" so that it is \"forwarded\" to all vehicles for some duration). If the latter, then where is the meta-data describing how often it is transmitted and duration (i.e., the APDU potentially contains other data)?</span></p>"

While a conformant RSU is required to support all mandatory operations defined within NTCIP 1218, ensuring that a given RSU actually supports every possible combination of mandatory and optional requirements would be impractical. Instead, most agencies only require that the device be tested to a standard set of procedures, which would use standardized dialogs (as defined in Section 4.2, and Annex G). To improve communications efficiency, management stations may use non-standard dialogs (e.g., a combination of GET and/or SET requests that is not defined as a standardized dialog, but which a conformant device is required to support according to the MAX-ACCESS rules defined in Section 5). Because these more efficient dialogs may not be known until the acquisition of the management station, which may be years after the acquisition of the device, there is a potential for an interoperability problem to arise.</p>",

This design morphed it into an \"application layer broadcast\". i.e., the management station sets an SNMP payload object and directs the RSU to send to the V2X interface per a set of rules. However, those rules do not specify exactly when it is broadcasted and Bits 2 &amp; 3 in the Options parameter imply that it is repeatedly broadcast (at some unknown rate, perhaps continuously).</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: rgb(247, 218, 100);\">Do we want to 1) redesign this capability to conform with the stated user need, 2) revise the user need to more closely resemble the design and revise the design to address ambiguities? Is there any case where Bits 2 and 3 apply to this capability?</span></p>",

              "text": "<p>The NTCIP RSU WG originally identified a user need to configure an RSU to be part of a coordinated group of RSUs, based on the features identified in RSU 4.1 Spec. This user need allows a set of RSUs to exchange data as a single unit. Multiple RSUs may be needed to extend the wireless communications coverage at a location, such as a signalized intersection that covers a large geographic area or an area with line-of-sight problems (e.g., trees). This feature also allows the RSUs to manage the messages that may be received by the set of RSUs to act as one unit so that a message is sent only once to a network destination (by a designated unit) to conserve bandwidth. In this scenario, the designated RSU becomes the basis for the configuration for the RSUs that together operate as a single unit. However, during the requirements definition phase, the NTCIP RSU WG determined that a TMC can better manage and operate the RSU master/client relationship and synchronization than trying to configure and manage synchronization among the RSUs. Four requirements were derived from this user need. The requirements text follows.</p>",
